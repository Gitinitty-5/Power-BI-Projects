This dataset contains information that helps us learn about people who get money from insurance companies. Insurance is like a protection plan against future uncertainties

Why is this Information Important?
Based on the information, we can see patterns and trends that help us understand who is most likely to need insurance money.

This is important because it can help us:

*Make Better Decisions: When we know who is most likely to need insurance, we can make better decisions about who to offer our services to.

*Help People in Need: By understanding who is most vulnerable, we can create policies that help those people get the support they need.
